## 📚 Enhanced Content Examples

### **Programming (IP)**
```
Topic: Pointers & Arrays
Content: Array name is constant pointer to first element. 
         arr[i] ≡ *(arr+i)
Exam Point: ⭐ Array name cannot be changed. Practice array 
            access using pointers.
Application: Efficient array processing, image manipulation, 
             matrix operations
```

### **Mathematics (LAAC)**
```
Topic: Eigen Values
Content: Av = λv, where v ≠ 0. λ: eigenvalue, v: eigenvector
Exam Point: ⭐ Eigenvectors are not unique (scalar multiples)
Application: Google PageRank, facial recognition, quantum 
             mechanics
```

### **Chemistry (CHE)**
```
Topic: Nernst Equation
Content: E = E° - (0.059/n)log(Q) at 25°C
Exam Point: ⭐ At equilibrium: E = 0, so E° = (0.059/n)log(K)
Application: pH meters, concentration cells, analytical 
             chemistry
```
